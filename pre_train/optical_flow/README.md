# Optical Flow

The optical flow estimation network is based on the implementation of PWC-Net from [RanhaoKang/PWC-Net_pytorch](https://github.com/RanhaoKang/PWC-Net_pytorch).

## Testing

Run the script:
  <pre><code>
  ./predict.sh
  </code></pre>

The results are in the [example](example) folder, including the warped image, the estimated flow data and the visualized flow image.
